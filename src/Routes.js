/**
 * This component uses this Switch component from React-Router that 
 * renders the first matching route that is defined within it. 
 * For now we only have a single route, it looks for / and renders 
 * the Home component when matched. We are also using the exact prop 
 * to ensure that it matches the / route exactly. This is because the 
 * path / will also match any route that starts with a /.
 * 
 * By using the route path /wines/:id we are telling the router to send all matching 
 * routes to our component Wines. This will also end up matching the route /wines/new 
 * with an id of new. To ensure that doesnâ€™t happen, we put our /wines/new route before 
 * the pattern matching one.
